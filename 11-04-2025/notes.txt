📌 CSS position Properties – Quick Notes

1. static (Default)

	• 👉 Elements follow the normal flow.
	• ❌ No top/left/bottom/right works.

2. relative
	• 📍 Element stays in normal flow,
	• ✅ But you can shift it using top/left/right/bottom.

3. absolute
	• 🪂 Removed from normal flow.
	• ⚠️ If no ancestor is positioned, it refers to <html>

4. fixed
	• 🚀 Stays fixed on the screen — doesn’t move while scrolling.
	• 🔒 Position based on viewport (screen).
	• Used for: Sticky headers, floating buttons.

5. sticky
	• 🧷 Acts like relative first,
	• 🧲 Then sticks to a position when scrolled.
	• ✅ Requires a top, left, right, or bottom value.
